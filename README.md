👋 Hi, I’m Dmitrii (@Dmitrycoin)

💻 QA Engineer by day — focused on bug hunting, writing test cases, and building test automation scripts. I enjoy improving quality, reliability, and dev workflows.

🛠️ On the side, I build Telegram bots and backend tools (mostly in Python/Node.js) to automate boring or repetitive tasks.

🧠 I’ve been deep into crypto since 2018 — exploring DeFi, NFTs, and on-chain mechanics. I’ve actively participated in testnets and love digging into new protocols before they hit mainnet.

⚙️ Currently learning smart contract testing, dApp integration, and getting comfortable with tools like Hardhat, Foundry, and Ethers.js.

🚀 I’m looking to grow as a Web3/backend developer. I’m not an expert yet — but I learn fast, ask questions early, and I ship.

📬 Feel free to reach out on Telegram: @Deeecoin
